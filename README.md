# Comparative Analysis of Early Kidney Disease Detection Using Various Machine Learning Models

This repository presents a comparative analysis workflow for early detection of **Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)** using various classical and machine learning models. The project demonstrates preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and performance comparison to identify the most effective approaches for early CKD prediction.

The work is supported by exploratory analysis, model pipelines, and a detailed research paper summarizing methodology, experiments, and results.
